# Lab Report 1 - Remote Access and FileSystem

## Installing VS Code

As we use the terminal in VS Code for Remote Access, we were required to download VS Code. 
If the user is using Windows, the user also had to download Git Bash, in order to use Git Bash in terminal. 
However, as I already had VS COde from CSE 11 with Professor Cao, and Git Bash from personal projects, I did not have to separately download either installer.

Below is a picture of VS Code running on my Windows computer.
